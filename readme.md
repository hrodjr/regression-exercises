# Regression Exercise

The regression exercise repository will be used to maintain all regression exercises to include my .gitignore and env.py files for future use throught the regression section of the syllabus.

Contained in this repository is a wrangle.ipynb (acquire and prepare) file holding necessary functions for regression exercises.
